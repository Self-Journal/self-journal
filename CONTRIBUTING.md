- Keep functions small and focused

#### Components
- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and reusable
- Extract complex logic into custom hooks
- Use proper TypeScript types for props

```

### Testing

Currently, we don't have automated tests, but please manually test:

1. **Functionality** - Does your change work as expected?
2. **Edge cases** - What happens with empty data, invalid input, etc.?
3. **Different views** - Test on mobile, tablet, and desktop
4. **PWA** - Test offline functionality if applicable
5. **Dark mode** - Ensure UI works in both themes

### Database Migrations

3. Document the changes in the PR description
4. Include rollback instructions if applicable
